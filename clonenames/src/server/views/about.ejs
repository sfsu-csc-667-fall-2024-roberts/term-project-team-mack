                Codenames is a popular board game that was created by Vlaada Chv√°til in 2015. The game is designed for 4-8 players and is played in two teams. The game is a word-based game where players give one-word clues to their teammates to help them guess the correct words on the board. The game is won when one team correctly guesses all of their words first.

                We recreated this game using Node, Express, EJS, and Socket.IO. The game is designed to be played online with friends and family. We hope you enjoy playing Codenames as much as we enjoyed creating it!
