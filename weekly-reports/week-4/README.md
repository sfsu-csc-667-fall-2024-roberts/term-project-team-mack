# Week 4 
Team K 
[github repository](https://github.com/sfsu-csc-667-fall-2024-roberts/term-project-team-mack) | [github project board](https://github.com/orgs/sfsu-csc-667-fall-2024-roberts/projects/1)

This week we downloaded postgresql and ensured that we could connect to a database created with postgres in our application. We set up the scripts to be able to create the migrations and to also rollback changes we've done. We also made simple forms in our login and sign up page. They aren't styled but we plan to do that at a later point in time. We created the database logic to interact with the database for anything involving users such as registering them and logging them in. We've created a separate file to hold our SQL to organize our code. We've also created login and register routes.
